# React Animation Playground

Here I plan to make cool animations using React Motion for now since League uses it.

## Install Instructions

1. Make sure you have `node` `v12.3.1` installed and `yarn`.
2. In terminal, navigate to your local copy of this repo. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start` to serve locally! It'll be live on `localhost:3000/`, and supports hot-reloading.
